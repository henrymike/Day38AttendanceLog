# The Iron Yard - Mobile Engineering (iOS)
### DC 2015 Fall

## Day 33 Homework - Part 1
### AttendanceLog

To get the most out of The Iron Yard, it's important that you show up everyday, on time, and use the available time to practice (especially while someone is available to help).

MINIMUM requirements for this entire assignment:
* Write an app that tracks attendance
* When a student arrives, they should be able to hold their phone close to the beacon and get a confirmation that their attendance has been logged
* Use Parse to store the attendance data
* When the day is done, they should hold their device near the beacon again and it should mark their attendance as done
* This implies that the app will also need Parse Login to know who the person is

HARD MODE requirements for this project:
* Present the user with a local notification (that's a thing, and we haven't done it yet, so you'll have to look it up) say that they entered The Iron Yard

## Day 33 Homework - Part 2
### Weekly News

A significant part of being a developer is keeping up with technology, especially in mobile, and particularly in iOS. We get significant changes at least 2x a year (one for hardware and one for software), and sometimes even more often. It's difficult, if not impossible, to keep up. One way to try to keep up is to keep tabs on the weekly news. So, every week you will have an assignment to find an article and share it with the class.

MINIMUM requirements for this assignment:
* Find a _unique_, _recent_ news article and share it to the iOS class on Slack
* UNIQUE: You must be the first to share that topic on Slack. A similar article on the same topic does not count.
* RECENT: It must be from the last 7 days, ideally within the last few days
* I am the ultimate arbiter of unique & recent
* Be prepared to discuss your (and everyone else's article) in the next lecture

## Day 33 Homework - Part 3
### Blog Post

Learning is not just about participating in a lecture & doing your homework. Learning takes reflection. So, every week part of your homework will be to write a blog post. The topic of each post is up to you. It can be a reflection on how you are feeling in class at that moment. It can be an instruction guide for others on how to do something we covered in class. It can be a summary of the things we've covered in class. It can be your opinions about recent news in mobile. It should be something that is either directly or tangentially related to the class.

MINIMUM requirements for this assignment:
* If you don’t have a blog, start one. If you have one, use that. Suggested Blog Sites: Medium, WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger, etc.
* Write what ever you want. Suggested Topics: how you're feeling about class, a summary of topics for the week, creating a tutorial for a particular topic, a summary of weekly mobile news, etc.
* When you’re done, post it and send me a link. If you want to keep it private, that’s fine just show me that it's posted.
